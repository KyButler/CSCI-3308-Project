Met up at Library again, deeply examined IRC Client idea.

We then realized this probably woudln't be the best idea. Instead, we wanted to make a chat program, and it seemed that IRC was a little too developed. Once agreeing that we should switch our focus to a more chat between people based app instead of this whole 'IRC' type idea, we planned out our upcoming weeks. Assigned roles to each person, such as who is focusing on JS and who is focusing on HTML.

We're much more liking this new idea.
